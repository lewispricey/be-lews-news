## Setup
The project utilises development and test PSQL databases, in order to run the app you will need to setup a new .env file for each database (.env.test & .env.development).

Both files will need to contain the following line: PGDATABASE=<database_name_here>

You can find the database names inside the setup.sql file in the db directory
